Customers of this service are sending billions of requests each day that need to be
processed. This service filters out
invalid requests (badly formatted, containing invalid values, missing
required fields, â€¦) but keeps a history on a day-by-day basis so that
the customers can be properly charged for the traffic they send.

This contains an HTTP service that 
- receives requests generated by the collector
- checks the validity of each request
- rejects invalid requests
- counts and stores statistics per customer per hour
All valid requests are passed to a stub.

The service also provides
- an endpoint to get the statistics
  - for a specific customer 
  AND
  - a specific day
The response also contains the total number of requests for that day.

### Requests considered as invalid are:
* malformed JSON
* missing one or more fields
* with a customer ID not found in the database or for a customer which is disabled
* with a remote IP address which is in the blacklist
* with a user agent which is in the blacklist

### The stats table contains:
* one entry per hour and per customer ID
* the `request_count` column contains the number of valid requests
* the `invalid_count` column will be used for the number of invalid requests
